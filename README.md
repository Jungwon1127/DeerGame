# DeerGame

INCOMPLETE

How to run my code
Run the main.py program, must have the library arcade installed.

Motivation
Inspired by the deer that ran through one of dorms at my school, tried to create a deer game where the deer attempts to reach that dorm without being caught by student. 

Description
User has to collect all the apples before getting caught by the student and make it to the dormitory to beat the game. 

Keys/Buttons
Arrow Keys move the player

Python Concepts Utilized
Used the coordinates for the user to indicate which direction the student should move, effectively chasing the deer at a slightly slower speed to make the game easier.

Arcade Features Utilized

Challenges/Lessons
Still struggling to figure out how to use the resources availabled in arcade. 

Future Steps
Add in logic when the player makes contact with student to end the game
Add in logic when the player makes it to the goal with all the apples the game ends
Add in ending screen
Add in begining screen 
use Tiled to create lvls to load in for multiple lvls. 
possibly add more than just apples for collectibles or points
add sounds for goal, losing, etc
add more images for better aesthetic
add in moving animations. 
Learn to properly implement scrolling capabilites 
restrict screen without having to place walls around all the corners
